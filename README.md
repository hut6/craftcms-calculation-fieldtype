## Hut6 Calculation Field

A simple Craft CMS fieldtype for generating a non editable value using dynamic data.

This basically is a copy of Podio's calculation field. For more info, visit [https://help.podio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201019358-Calculations](https://help.podio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201019358-Calculations)

Calculated values are stored in the database as strings. Storing as number or date would be great, but this is a work in progress...

Also thanks to Lewis Jenkins, as some of his code was used to make this plugin. [https://github.com/lewisjenkins/craft-lj-dynamicfields](https://github.com/lewisjenkins/craft-lj-dynamicfields)
